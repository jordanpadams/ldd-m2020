    The Mars 2020 mission dictionary contains classes and attributes specific to
    the Mars 2020 (Perseverance Rover) mission and its instruments.
    
    Mars 2020 version 1.0.0.0 
    PDS Build 1.14.0.0
    LDDTool version 11.3.1
    
    Built with LDDTool -plJ1  MARS2020.xml

    2020-07-29 Confirmed spacecraft clock count notation (Bob Deen)
    2020-08-11 Revised some attribute names to be consistent with msn discipline dictionary, for efficient searches:
      product_type_name replaces product_type
      release_number replaces release_id (but it is still an ASCII string)
      spacecraft_clock_start replaces spacecraft_clock_start_count
      spacecraft_clock_stop replaces spacecraft_clock_stop_count
      spacecraft_clock_partition replaces spacecraft_clock_count_partition
      start_local_true_solar_time_sol and stop_local_true_solar_time_sol replace local_true_solar_time_sol
    2020-08-19 Removed enumerated values list for product_type_name, until we know what values to use, if any
    2020-08-20 Changed mars2020:error:sclk_rule_0 to allow spacecraft_clock_start and stop to be evaluated independently
    2020-08-25 Added container class Mars2020_Parameters
    2020-08-28 Added classes PIXL_Illumination and SuperCam_RMI_Mini_Header and their attributes, from Bob Deen

   description             This class contains the "mini-header" for the SuperCam RMI camera on Mars 2020. The mini- header is a set of information that is tightly tied to the camera hardware, and the instrument team finds value in keeping the set of mini- header information together. Much (but not all) of the information is also included in appropriate sections of the discipline dictionaries, which is where general users should go.
